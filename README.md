# Quickxo
> By Gilles Dumoulin

Quickxo is **not** an MVC framework but a compact [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) **implementation** of the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

MVC frameworks  are really great. However, due to the complexity of their APIs, 
there is additional time learning to use them.

Quickxo provides a quick starting point to get an MVC compliant website without the 
complexity of a complete MVC framework.

- Quickxo can be used immediately because it is a simple implementation. There is no
framework-specific constraint to learn and to comply with. Just code with it !

- Quickxo is really simple to figure out, its footprint is minimum (30 kb) and 
therefore allows it to be very fast.

- Quickxo is robust. It also implements [Front Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller) and 
[Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) design patterns. 
It is supposed to be used in production and can be easily unit tested.

- If needed, as it is an MVC implementation, the website can be quickly ported to an MVC framework afterwards.

You can check out the code, put it at the root server directory and the website is up and running.
You can also refer to the [few Wiki pages](https://github.com/Quickxo/quickxo-java/wiki) to get started, it is straightforward.
